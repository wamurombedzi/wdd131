            <h2> Dashboard: Defined</h2>

            <p>I chose to work on Dashboard project because i regard them as useful on the basis that they help for
                monitoring, measuring and analyzing relevant data in key areas.
                They take raw data from many sources and clearly present it in a way that it is highly tailored to the
                viewer's needs, regardless of you who you are, be it you
                are a business leader, line of business leader, line of business analyst, sales representative or
                teacher</p>
